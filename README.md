This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application built using Java Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and HTML/CSS (Bootstrap) for managing student records.

Features:
Add a new student
Edit existing student information
Delete a student
View all students in a tabular format

Technologies Used:
Java 8+
Spring Boot
Spring MVC
Thymeleaf (for server-side rendering)
HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 4.4.1)

Note:
The HTML and CSS design was handled by chatgpt, and I worked on the backend functionality and Thymeleaf template integration using Spring Boot.
